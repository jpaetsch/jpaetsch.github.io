## Summary
A personal website for my personal information and portfolio. This project also serves as practice for frontend design, development using React and frontend animation, and a place to direct potential job opportunities.

## Setup & Usage
The site is hosted at [](https://jpaetsch.github.io/)

## Potential Improvements
Add better animations and continue to design a more unique site - currently working closely using an online example as a [template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI).

## Technologies
* React (JavaScript library)
* GitHub Pages (deployment/hosting)
* GSAP Animation (library)
* FortAwesome (free icons and fonts)

## Inspiration
Wanted to set up a lightstrip and have it controllable by an app I program from my phone (also see the controller app repository).  Also want to eventually connect to the Spotify API to automatically set the lights depending on songs, genres, etc and have 'smart, responsive' patterns.

## Sources
Online resources used extensively.
Original site was created following the [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI) made by the[freeCodeCamp.org channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) and frontend developer Slobodan
