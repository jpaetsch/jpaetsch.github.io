## Inspiration
At the beginning of this project, I had little familarity with the React library or frontend development using JavaScript. I wanted to gain experience in these areas and have a website of my own to personalize and continue to improve over time as I add new projects to my portfolio. In addition, I want to practice animation, responsive web design, and other modern web development concepts.

## Sources
Online resources used extensively.
Original site was created following the [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI) made by the [freeCodeCamp.org channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) and frontend developer Slobodan.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) comprehensive React tutorial was also very helpful in getting a deeper dive into more advanced concepts.
