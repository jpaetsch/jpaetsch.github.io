## Summary
A personal website for my personal information and portfolio. This project also serves as practice for frontend design, development using React and frontend animation, and a place to direct potential job opportunities.

## Setup & Usage
The site is hosted at [](https://jpaetsch.github.io/)

## Potential Improvements
Add better animations and continue to design a more unique site - currently working closely using an online example as a [template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI).

## Technologies
* React (JavaScript library)
* GitHub Pages (deployment/hosting)
* GSAP Animation (library)
* FortAwesome (free icons and fonts)

## Inspiration
At the beginning of this project, I had little familarity with frontend design. I wanted to get experience with frontend development and have a website of my own to personalize and continue to improve over time as I add new projects to my portfolio. In addition, I want to practice animation, responsive web design, and other modern web development concepts.
