## Inspiration
At the beginning of this project, I had little familarity with frontend design. I wanted to get experience with frontend development and have a website of my own to personalize and continue to improve over time as I add new projects to my portfolio. In addition, I want to practice animation, responsive web design, and other modern web development concepts.
